# freeCodeCamp ‚Äì Responsive Web Design Projects

This repo includes all the projects I built while working through the freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design course. Everything here is done with just HTML and CSS ‚Äî no frameworks, no JavaScript.

## üìÅ Certification Projects

Found in `0. Certification Projects/`:
1. Survey Form  
2. Technical Documentation  
3. Product Landing Page  
4. Tribute Page  
5. **Personal Portfolio Webpage** ‚Äì A responsive site built completely from scratch. I focused on layout, animations, and making it mobile-friendly using only CSS. This was my favorite one to work on.

## üîß Other Practice Projects

The folders `1.` to `15.` contain exercises from the course covering topics like:
- Flexbox and Grid
- Pseudo-selectors
- CSS transforms and animations
- Forms, accessibility, and responsive layout techniques

## Notes

These projects helped me get through the full curriculum and apply what I learned step-by-step.
